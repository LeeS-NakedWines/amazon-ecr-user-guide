# Pushing an image<a name="image-push"></a>

You can push your Docker images, manifest lists, and Open Container Initiative \(OCI\) images and compatible artifacts to your repository\. The following pages describe these in more detail\.

**Note**  
Your images can be replicated to other repositories across Regions in your own registry and across accounts by specifying a replication configuration in your registry settings\. For more information, see [Private registry settings](registry-settings.md)\.
